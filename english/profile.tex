\begin{rubric}{Summary}

\text{
I am an IT professional who takes on challenges by driving change \textbf{with or without technology} as a hands-on leader with contentment as mind-set (not as a goal) and \textbf{inspire people} to overachieve.\newline

Analytically I am strong, with good communication skills and I enjoy the \textbf{beauty of simplicity} and innovation.\newline 

I am influenced by the ''Getting-Things-Done'' methodology and the ''Maker movement''. I accept and strive in \textbf{my leadership roles} with courage and tactical ingenuity to \textbf{take people with me} where possible and also believe in professional conflict as a tool where appropriate.\newline

My family keeps me rooted and there is almost nothing better than exploring the world with my inquisitive kids to take the world upside down.
